# Java Object Oriented Design

This repository holds some of my learnings during the UNSW course COMP2911: Engineering Design in Computing. This course was taught in Java and focused on object oriented design, the software lifecycle and problem solving design methodologies.

The directories in this repository each contain a solution to a small programming task that we were given. They exhibit OO design concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, interfaces and design patterns, using data structures such as queues and graphs.
